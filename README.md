# Customer-Segmentation-Visualization-Advanced-Analysis
The project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunications company and develop predictive models to identify at-risk customers. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and improve customer retention. Built Excel models with pivot tables, conditional logic, and KPI calculations to track churn rates and retention metrics

The Customer Segmentation Visualization & Advanced Analysis project focuses on understanding customer behavior by grouping individuals into meaningful segments and uncovering actionable insights. It combines data analytics, visualization, and advanced statistical techniques to help businesses tailor strategies for different customer groups.

Key Objectives
- Identify distinct customer segments based on demographics, purchase behavior, and engagement patterns.
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for advanced segmentation.
- Visualize customer groups with interactive dashboards and charts for easy interpretation.
- Provide insights into customer lifetime value, churn risk, and targeted marketing opportunities.

Tools & Techniques
- SQL: Extracting and preparing customer datasets from transactional databases.
- Python: Using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib/seaborn for clustering and analysis.
- Visualization: Building dashboards in Power BI/Tableau to present customer segments clearly.
- Advanced Analysis: Applying statistical methods and machine learning models to validate and refine segmentation.

 Impact
This project helps organizations:
- Personalize marketing campaigns for different customer groups.
- Improve customer retention by identifying high-risk segments.
- Optimize resource allocation by focusing on high-value customers.
- Enhance decision-making with clear, data-driven visual insights.
